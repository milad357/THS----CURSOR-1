⚠️  LOGO FILES MISSING ⚠️

To see your logo on the website, you need to add these files here:

1. logo-light.png  (white/light background version)
2. logo-gray.png   (gray background version)
3. logo-dark.png   (black/dark background version)

Copy your uploaded logo file to this folder and rename it to these three names.

See QUICK_LOGO_SETUP.md for detailed instructions.
